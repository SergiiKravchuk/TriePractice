/**
 * Represents a Trie (prefix tree or k-ary tree) data structure for storing and managing strings.
 * A Trie can be highly effective for scenarios that involve fast prefix-based search operations,
 * such as autocomplete and spell checking.
 * <br>
 * Time Complexity:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Insertion: O(m), where m is the length of the word being inserted.</li>
 * <li> Search (contains): O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched.</li>
 * <li> Prefix Search (containsPrefix): O(m), where m is the length of the prefix.</li>
 * <li> Deletion: O(m), where m is the length of the word being removed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the worst case, the space complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of words stored in the Trie
 * and m is the average length of these words, although space efficiency is improved by sharing common prefixes.

   * <br>
   * <p>The removal operation considers three possible cases:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li><b>1. Isolated Word</b>: If the word exists as a complete word with no other word branching from
   *    its nodes, all nodes for the word are removed from the Trie.</li>
   * <li><b>2. Prefix of Another Word</b>: If the word to be removed is a prefix of another word
   *    (e.g., removing "cat" when "cater" exists), only the end-of-word marker for the word is removed,
   *    while the nodes are retained.</li>
   * <li><b>3. Contains Another Word as a Prefix</b>: If the word contains another word as a prefix
   *    (e.g., removing "cater" when "cat" exists), only the nodes beyond the shorter word are removed,
   *    leaving "cat" intact.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <br>
   * Hints:<br>
   * 1. Start from the root node and initialize variables to keep track of:<br>
   *    - The current node as you traverse.<br>
   *    - The last "fork" node (node with more than one child or marking the end of another word).<br>
   *    - The child index at the fork node.<br>
   * 2. As you iterate through each character of the lowercase string:<br>
   *    - Use {@link #getBucketIndex(char)} to find the appropriate child node.<br>
   *    - If a node for a character doesn’t exist, the word is not in the Trie; exit the method.<br>
   *    - If the current node marks the end of another word or has multiple children, update<br>
   *      the fork node to this node and store the current child index.<br>
   * 3. After reaching the last character, check if the node is marked as the end of a word.<br>
   *    - If it’s not marked, the word does not exist as a complete word; exit the method.<br>
   *    - If it is marked, unmark this node as the end of the word.<br>
   * 4. If the final node has no children (i.e., is no longer needed), backtrack:<br>
   *    - Use the fork node and the child index to remove all nodes after the fork node.<br>
