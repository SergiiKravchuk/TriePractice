# Welcome, Data Structure lover 🧑‍💻

This repository contains a training exercise to get familiar with **Trie** data structure.

## Prerequisites:
* [JDK 11+](https://jdk.java.net/11/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## How to start practicing? 💪
* check the [onboarding presentation](https://github.com/SergiiKravchuk/TriePractice/blob/practicing/src/main/resources/Codeus%20Trie%20Data%20Structure.pdf) on the Trie data structure
* choose branch as difficulty:
    * `practicing`(default) - contains general docs, suited for those who want to practice the Trie data structure implementation.
    * `learning` - contains detailed hints to help you learn the Trie data structure implementation.
* open `org.codeus.Trie` class and implement all classes and methods. It is better to start implementing `Node` and `Trie` classes' fields and constructors.
* run `org.codeus.TrieTest` to verify your implementation.

If you are stuck, check the `completed` branch to see the completed implementation.

### Extra objectives 🔥
Implement methods recursively/iteratively (pick the one you have not done) - start with remove method.
